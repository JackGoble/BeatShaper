This project uses a neural network to generate a beatmap for a given song.  The model is trained on beatmaps that are of expert difficulty and are highly rated within the www.beatsaver.com community.  

## Getting Started
Before you can run this project, you will need to install some programs and dependencies.

### Installing necessary programs
1. Python 3 or higher:  Python 3 is necessary to run another program that we use: Jupyter Notebook.  Python 3 can be found at https://python.org/downloads/

2. Jupyter Notebook:  The project is written in .ipynb files.  To open these files, you'll need Jupyter Notebook.  You can install this at https://jupyter.org/install

3. PIP:  PIP is a python package manager.  It is necessary to easily install the dependencies of this project.  You can find out how to install PIP at https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
