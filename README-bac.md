# Team Pandemonium

This project uses a neural network to generate a beatmap for a given song.  The model is trained on beatmaps that are of expert difficulty and are highly rated within the www.beatsaver.com community.  

## Getting Started
Before you can run this project, you will need to install some programs and dependencies.

### Installing necessary programs
1. Python 3 or higher:  Python 3 is necessary to run another program that we use: Jupyter Notebook.  Python 3 can be found at https://python.org/downloads/

2. Jupyter Notebook:  The project is written in .ipynb files.  To open these files, you'll need Jupyter Notebook.  You can install this at https://jupyter.org/install

3. PIP:  PIP is a python package manager.  It is necessary to easily install the dependencies of this project.  You can find out how to install PIP at https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

4. FFmpeg:  FFmpeg is a tool used within the project.  Please go to https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg and follow the instructions written to install this.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Demo
Now that you have everything set up, you can start the demo.  The demo of this project can be found in the subdirectory named 'Demo'.  There is a file in there (demo.ipynb) that contains a walkthrough of the project.  Going through this demo and running the code will give you a better understanding of the project.
