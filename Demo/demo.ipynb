    "# Gathering the Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to gather the training data. If you want to gather your own data and train your own model, follow the steps below. Alternatively, you can skip the training and use our pre-trained model instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading beatmaps\n",
    "So, to create the training data, we need a collection of songs with corresponding player-created beatmaps. The cell below contains two options for this. Firstly, you can create folders inside the \"songs\" directory and put .ogg files and beatmaps inside them (if you download beatmaps from beatsaver.com, this is the easiest method as it only requires that you download the zip files and extract them in the \"songs\" directory. Make sure that there is no more than one song per directory). The second option is to manually write out a list of song paths and beatmap paths for song_list and beatmap_list, respectively. Because of licensing and copyright issues, we are unable to provide you with any songs or beatmaps that we used to train our network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain songs and beatmaps for training, we recommend visiting www.beatsaver.com and downloading whichever songs you wish to use. Files in www.beatsaver.com will usually be a .zip file, and will contain an audio file (.ogg), and the beatmap files (.json) which can be extracted to their own separate folders inside the \"songs\" director.  Depending on the song, there may be multiple beatmap files. Currently, the get_song_list function will only work with Expert and ExpertPlus difficulty levels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to manually create the song_list and beatmap_list, make sure that the corresponding song and beatmap files are at the same indices, and also comment out the last line of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"samples_per_chunk\", \"chunks_per_beat\", and \"beats_per_sequence\" are important user-defined variables that will affect the training of the network in various ways. All of these variables must have values for future cells to run properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chunk: A division of a beat. It is the smallest unit of time in which the neural net can place note blocks. e.g. for 4/4 time songs, a value of 2 chunks per beat would mean that each chunk represents a 1/8 note.\n",
    "2. Sequence: The equally-sized sections into which a song is divided for training the neural net.\n",
    "3. samples_per_chunk: Defines the resolution/quality of the sound that the network will be able to use. A high value will provide higher quality information, but will take up more memory and storage space. We've found that 300 provides a high enough quality for most use cases. It is important to note that the song will be resampled based on this value and the BPM.  \n",
    "4. chunks_per_beat: As stated above, if a song is in 4/4 time, a value of 2 for this would mean that each chunk represents an 8th note, a value of 4 would mean that each chunk is a 16th note, etc.\n",
    "5. beats_per_sequence: The number of beats in a sequence. A high value for this increases the amount of time that the neural network can look back to recognize patterns. If the value for this is too high (the number of beats in a song) or too low (under 10), problems could arise, or the network could fail to learn well. Similarly, values around the midpoint will cause the generated training data to be very large. We recommend 32 or 64, but most choices are viable."

The second value is the number of chunks per sequence, i.e. chunks_per_beat * beats_per_sequence. The third value in X will be samples_per_chunk/2.
